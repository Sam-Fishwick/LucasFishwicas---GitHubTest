Learning to use terminal in vim

CTRL_W+w to switch between windows (vim and terminal [in vim]
+++ Doesnt seem to work now -- checking using ":help window" 
+++ Just stopped working .. restarting computer worked

Learning ":b <tab>" (with set wildmenu on) - Navigate between buffers (opened files)
+++ ":e file.txt" to open new buffer to edit, then ":b vert term" to return to this buffer
+++ Should be able to :split vim and open buffer to work with 2 files
+++ ":split <file name> will open <file name> in split window (previously I simply
":split" and changed the buffer with ":b <file name>

Window size can be changed with ":resize <+/-> <int>" 
+++ int value represents lines added (+) or removed (-)

Relative window size can be controlled with ctrl-w
+++ ctrl-w _ (| for vertical) maxes out the current window size
+++ ctrl-w = splits windows evenly
+++ ctrl-w R will swap window positions
